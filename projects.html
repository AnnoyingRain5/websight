        <p>ComicWorld is a website designed to provide a home for comic series to live, seperate from social media and
            other creations</p>
        <p>It is currently invite-only, if you would like to gain access to post, please contact me, my info is on the

        <p>Ever wanted an under-featured chat app that sorta works? No? Well bad luck! Relink exists!</p>

        <h2><a href="https://top.gg/bot/1018460858625572924/">RainyBot</a></h2>
        <p>A discord bot that features translation, quick-responses... and that's it!</p>

        <h2><a href="https://github.com/AnnoyingRain5/Paradox-Victini/">Paradox Victini</a></h2>
        <p>A discord bot made for <a href="https://discord.gg/victini">The Victini Pub</a>, a discord server all about
            Victini! Hence the name</p>
        <p>It handles some basic moderation internally, allows users to get a role with any colour of their choosing,
            runs polls and makes questions easier to identify in #qna-discussion</p>
        <p>This bot is mostly hardcoded, and would need to be modified to work anywhere else</p>

        <p>That's right, I made a bad version of the (un)popular webgame <a href="https://guessthehex.com/">Guess The
                Hex</a>, and put it on a Raspberry Pi Pico!</p>
        <p>Why? I am still figuring that out myself...</p>

        <p>Yes, I made this, and yes, I'm sorry</p>
        <p>I am only really linking to this now because it was on every previous version of the website</p>
        <p>Yes, even the one made in Microsoft Word.</p>
